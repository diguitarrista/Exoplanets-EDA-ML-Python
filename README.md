# Exoplanets Data Analysis and Machine Learning
In this project, we conducted an analysis of a dataset containing celestial body characteristics to predict planet statuses using a Random Forest classifier

# Overview

This project aims to predict the status of planets (either "Candidate" or "Confirmed") based on various celestial characteristics using a Random Forest classifier. It encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection and removal, machine learning modeling, and evaluation of the model's performance.

# Dataset Description

The dataset includes features such as the radius, orbital period, mass, and radius of the star associated with each celestial body. These features were used to explore data distributions, relationships, and ultimately to predict the planet's status.

# Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent cleaning, including handling missing values and outlier removal using the Z-score method.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to understand data distributions and correlations between features.
- Modeling: Applied a Random Forest classifier to predict planet statuses.
- Evaluation: Assessed the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Results

The Random Forest model achieved reasonable accuracy, demonstrating the potential of machine learning techniques in classifying celestial bodies based on observational data. The project also highlighted the importance of data preprocessing and EDA in building effective predictive models.
